13-ORM
Description:
It was great learning how to link all the files together and seeing how they all talk to each other.  It is interesting how if you tell it to the computer will pull information from another file and display it on a webpage.  I can see how this example of using a database can be particularly helpful if you are going to be working for a company in the manufacturing industry, many of them use an ERP or MRP system to track sales, inventory, projects, and finances.  Some of the companies I have worked at would reach out to the software company that they used for the ERP or MRP system and require changes to be made as they usually provided a default setup and any changes that the company wanted to make were made by a junior or senior developer to show other statistics about the company to be tracked by the software.
